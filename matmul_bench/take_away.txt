The following data is per warp: 
  doing an ldmatrix.m8n8.x4.bf16 has: 
      A latency of about 60 clocks 
      throughput of about 8-11 clocks 
      so the "pipe_depth" is around 6-8? 
  doing an mma.m16.n8.k16.bf16.bf16.f32 has: 
    A latency of about 34 clocks 
    throughput of about 4 clocks 
  "pipe_depth" is almost exactly 8.
